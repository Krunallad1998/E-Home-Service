<h1> About Us </h1>

<p> Now days, there are many problem in real time Home Service like Plumbing, Furniture, Electric, etc. The local area worker, those who are famous and easily get the work on bases of contract don't work for small home service and if they do so then they do  not  work on given time/day . And even they take high charges on small works. Even there are workers in the area that don't get work and are always in search of work. Those worker who have creative in their work and can do work at the low price and less time. </p>
<p> To solve the problem of the people and even to the unemployed people we are implementing an E- Home Service Web Application for the customer and worker so that people get their work done for small home services and workers get some wages for that. It is web application that can be accessed by the customer and workers both. In this project, the customer will post the work of their house. The worker would look at it and give their according charges with all details that would need to complete the work done. The worker can bid on the services which are posts by the customers. And if the customers like the worker offer than there could be the interaction between the customer and worker with chats. For all this there will be verification of the customer and worker by uploading live capture photo and then it will be verified by document upload by them, so its goanna be safe and secure connection between customers and workers. The same person has to work for they had been chosen and no other person is send to do work on that agreement the worker would be registered. After completion of the work, worker and customer both can define their work on the web application. Even customers can give rating to the workers so that ratings can help other customers to know about the work of worker.  Hence the web application would be totally secure, safe and very fruitful for the customers and the unemployed workers for home services.</p>
